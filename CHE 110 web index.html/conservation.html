    <h1>Water conservative method 1 in LPU :></h1>
    <p class="p1">There are several water conservation methods that can be adopted to reduce water wastage and promote sustainable 
        water management. One of the most effective ways to conserve water is to upgrade to efficient fixtures, such as low-flow 
        showerheads, faucets, and toilets[1]. Rainwater harvesting is another effective method of conserving water, which involves 
        collecting, filtering, storing, and using rainwater for irrigation and various other purposes[2].<br> Other methods include using
         water-efficient appliances, fixing leaky pipes, reducing shower time, turning off the tap while brushing teeth, and using a 
         brick in the toilet tank to reduce water usage[3][4]. Water conservation is essential to ensure the availability of clean and 
         safe water for future generations and to protect the environment from the negative impacts of water wastage.</p>

    <h1>Water  conservative method 2 in LPU:></h1>
    <p class="p1">
        There are several simple ways to conserve water at home, including:<br>
        • Running a full dishwasher instead of handwashing dishes[1]<br>
        • Reusing cooking water for plants[1]<br>
        • Turning off the faucet while brushing teeth or shaving[2]<br>
        • Collecting rainwater using a DIY water barrel for garden irrigation[3]<br>
        • Switching to a low-flow showerhead[2]<br>
        • Fixing leaky pipes and faucets[4]<br>
        • Upgrading to efficient fixtures, such as low-flow toilets and faucets[4]<br>
        • Using a broom instead of a hose to clean driveways and sidewalks[5]<br>
        • Only running the washing machine and dishwasher when they are full[1]<br>
        • Composting to reduce disposal use[1]<br>
        • Turning off the tap while washing dishes[1]<br>
        • Using a bucket instead of a hose to wash the car[5]<br>
        These simple methods can help reduce water usage and promote sustainable water management practices at home.<br>

   <h1 class="side"> Rain Water Harvesting :></h1>
        <p class="p1">Rainwater harvesting is a process of collecting and storing rainwater from surfaces where rain has fallen upon. 
            The collected rainwater can be used for various purposes, including irrigation, flushing toilets, washing clothes and utensils,
             and even for drinking after purification.<br> Rainwater harvesting can also be used on an industrial scale to provide the needed 
             amounts of water for many operations to take place smoothly without having to deplete nearby water sources. It can also lessen 
             the burden of soil erosion in a number of areas, allowing the land to thrive once again. The practice of rainwater harvesting
              has been around for thousands of years and has been growing at a rapid pace.Rainwater harvesting has many benefits and 
              advantages. It is a sustainable water management practice that can be implemented on many different levels, from a simple 
              rain barrel to a complex industrial system.<br> Rainwater harvesting can help reduce water bills, decrease overall water usage
               levels, and promote self-sufficiency. It can also help conserve water, reduce stormwater runoff, and solve drainage problems
                on properties. Rainwater is better for landscape plants and gardens because it is not chlorinated. <br>In addition, rainwater 
                harvesting can help sustain groundwater levels, lessen the burden of soil erosion, and provide a cheap and reliable source
                 of clean water in areas with water scarcity. Overall, rainwater harvesting is an important practice that can help address
                  many water-related challenges.
